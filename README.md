# Meet Up Event Planner
This app was created for the Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree.

Since one of my goals this year is to continue the transition from Angular to Angular 2, I chose to write this app using Angular 2.

## High Level Lessons Learned
* *Form Inputs* - There are two main options for creating forms in Angular 2 Declarative and Reactive Forms. `TODO: elaborate`
* *Unit Tests* - There are several types of unit tests. `TODO: elaborate`

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
